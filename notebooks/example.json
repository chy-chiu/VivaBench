    "history_freetext": "While watching television two hours prior to presentation, the patient experienced a sudden, severe spinning sensation described as vertigo, which was constant and rated 8/10 in severity. The dizziness was associated with nausea and vomiting and worsened by standing or moving his head. Simultaneously, he developed persistent blurred and double vision, rated 7/10 in severity, which was worse when looking to the left and accompanied by difficulty focusing. He also noticed sudden onset numbness and tingling on the left side of his face and right arm, along with mild weakness in the right arm. These symptoms persisted without clear exacerbating or relieving factors.",
